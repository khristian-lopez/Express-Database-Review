# Dog Database
This was a repo created for HR-LAX-49 to practice connecting a MySQL database to an Express server.

## Get Started
Install dependencies using
```
npm install
```

## User Story
Your team has been tasked with writing a full stack application that stores information about local dogs. Luckily, you don't have to write the whole thing, just the backend! Per their request, the server should be able to add dogs to the database, retrieve information about a specific dog or all dogs in the database, update information about any dog in the database, and delete any dog in the database. Your teammates working on the frontend have written their code to expect incoming data from GET requests in this shape:
```
[
  {
    name: 'Bibby',
    breed: 'Pomeranian',
    age: 3,
    owner: 'Tim'
  },
  {
    name: 'Drippy',
    breed: 'German Shephard',
    age: 1,
    owner: 'Rob'
  },
  {
    name: 'Goon',
    breed: 'Golden Retriever',
    age: 5,
    owner: 'Tex'
  }
]
```
